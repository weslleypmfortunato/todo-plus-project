<h2> 👨 About the developer</h2>

<p>I am a passionate animal lover with a keen interest in Canadian weather. After spending 13 years working for Foxconn manufacturing Apple products, where I gained valuable experience in project management and quality reliability testing in the electronics sector, I decided to take on a new challenge by moving to Canada and starting a new career in web development.

I am currently pursuing my dream of becoming a proficient web developer by attending college and learning everything from scratch. Being in Victoria, BC, allows me to explore my love for nature by hiking and discovering new places in my spare time.

I am a firm believer in continuous improvement and pay close attention to every detail, no matter how small, to ensure the final product is of the highest quality. I am excited to see where my newfound skills and experiences will take me, and I am eager to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.</p>
